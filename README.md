# virtualmouse
Followed along the 'Gesture Recognition on the basis of the colour green' with some additional changes. It performs 3 mouse functions: click, drag, release according to the number of contours (largest units) of green colour present in one frame. By default, it takes input from the camera at position 0, i.e., webcam of a computer, however I'd give the user a choice to choose among the available hardware in the future.  
The code doesn't entirely work yet; it hangs on an imshow() instance but I'm working on it to be strong and versatile.
